Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

Basically, the goal was to provide a simple weight-tracking application that anyone could use. You could be a beginner or Mr. Olympia. This app was designed for the widest variety of users possible.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I kept it more simple than I initially wanted to, this was due to some life stuff that came up and therefore narrowed my time. However, I think my UI is simple yet effective. The first screen is a login screen, the second allows you to input a weight, and the third is the main landing page for the application. I think my design was successful because it's intuitive and easy to use.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I watched a ton of youtube videos for this class. Taking everything I learned from both there and zyBooks was critical to learning how to code for this app. I took a modular approach. I tried not to hardcode anything and tried to keep things as organized, modular, and reusable as possible.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I created some fairly simple JUnit tests to test the functionality of my code. I think the testing phase is super important so a majority of my time was spent debugging.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

In my opinion, nothing I did was very innovative. However, regarding overcoming challenges, I ran into a lot when it came to working with the database. I overcame this by simply asking for help, watching YT videos on the subject, and reading through zyBooks.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I felt like the testing, database, and UI design were my most successful parts in demonstrating my knowledge, skills, and experience.
